  Logger
    * changed '->progress' to '->at', with sticky fraction denominator,
      and changed "maximum" language to "total", to match parser.
    * add '->inc' method
  Parser
    * optional 'sticky_message' feature can now hold onto message text
      from previous log lines.

Version 0.03 - 2016-12-24
  Add RenderTTY module to display progress on a terminal.
  Fixed a bug in Parser that clobbered $_.
  Renamed a few attributes in Parser.  Not backward compatible,
    but I doubt anyone has found this module on CPAN yet.
  Some doc improvements.
